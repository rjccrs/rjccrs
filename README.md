Hi, I'm Arjohn. 👋
I’m a Delivery Operations Lead and Computer Science graduate from Adamson University. For the past 13+ years at Accenture, I’ve been the "first line of defense" for Tier-1 clients like Google and Verizon.

While my professional path has been in Digital Marketing operations and GTM analytics, I am now strategically pivoting into Cybersecurity. I am returning to my technical roots to help organizations defend their digital assets.

🛡️ Why Cybersecurity?
In my work with YouTube Gaming, I managed backend configurations where data integrity and accuracy were everything. I realized that the parts of my job I found most rewarding weren't the marketing metrics, but the incident response, the rapid-response protocols, and the constant effort to maintain platform health.

🛠️ What I Bring to the Table

Operational Discipline: A decade of managing high-stakes, real-time monitoring for global campaigns.

Network Foundation: I hold a CCNA and have hands-on experience with network inventory analytics and technical diagrams.

Technical Roots: Strong foundational skills in SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Leadership: Experience leading cross-functional teams and managing complex stakeholder relationships.

📚 Currently Learning & Building
I’m actively closing the gap between my degree and today’s security landscape by:

🎓 Rigorously studying for the CompTIA Security+ to solidify my baseline security knowledge.

⚔️ Completing the TryHackMe SOC Analyst Level 1 (SAL1) professional certification to gain hands-on defensive skills.

💻 Building out a project-based portfolio right here on GitHub.

🔍 Immersing myself in the latest SOC and Threat Hunting methodologies.

📫 Let's Connect
I’m eager to bring my "battle-tested" operational experience and fresh technical training to a dedicated security team.
