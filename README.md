- 👋 Hi, I’m @rjccrs
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web Development thru freeCodeCamp
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact:  I am a driven individual who graduated from Adamson University in 2011 with a degree in Computer Science. After gaining valuable professional experience in Telco Industry and Digital Marketing, I am now strategically investing in a career pivot toward Web Development. I recognize the thirteen-year gap, and I am actively closing it by rigorously studying modern frameworks, building a project-based portfolio, and immersing myself in the development ecosystem. I am highly motivated to specialize, bring strong foundational skills in Digital Marketing, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and I am eager to contribute my dedication and fresh technical knowledge to a challenging development role.
